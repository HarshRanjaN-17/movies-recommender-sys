#### About the project

---

This is a machine learning model to recommend movies & tv series based on our preferences. This model is completely build in python using cosine similarity.

All entertainment websites or online stores have millions/billions of items. It becomes challenging for the customer to select the right one. At this place, recommender systems come into the picture and help the user to find the right item by minimizing the options. This model uses cosine similarity to find the similar movies.

##### Built With

- Python
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- Streamlit, Pickle
- TMBD API

##### Dataset Used

[TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset "TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset")
